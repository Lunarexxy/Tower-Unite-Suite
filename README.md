# Tower Unite Suite
 This is the Tower Unite Suite for Blender, version 1.3.74, originally created by Spoom.

 This is not Spoom's official repository for the Tower Unite Suite, nor do I represent him.
 I just felt it should be saved somewhere publicly available, as this version was previously only publicly accessible through a Google Drive link posted on the Pixeltail Forums, and who knows how long that'll last.

 Spoom has publicly stated that development on this tool has been abandoned, and I don't have the required expertise to maintain it if there are any major problems with the addon, or major changes to Blender or Tower Unite.
 Most likely I'll only be able to keep it running on the latest versions of Blender.

 Pixeltail is also currently working on a new workshop rig, so this tool or repository may eventually become obsolete.
 
 Despite all that, feel free to post issues if you find anything broken, or pull requests if you know how to fix them!

## How to install

* Download the latest release .zip
* Open Blender 3.2 or later (4.0+ works too!)
* Go to Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons and press the Install button at the top of the window.
* Find the .zip and select it.
* Check the checkbox next to the add-on in the list to enable it.

## How to use

I strongly recommend watching [this video by Niko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUCr28T8K-s), which explains how to use the Tower Unite Suite, among other things.

This [Steam Workshop guide by CarbonCopyCat](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2876260188) also has some helpful tips on how to fix common problems with the add-on.

Finally, the [Tower Unite Discord](https://discord.gg/pixeltail) always has people willing to help you learn how to port your models over to Tower Unite.
